SAP Activate's main focus is on addressing questions during the transition projects, but it also offers guidance for the discovery activities in the discover phase and details of how to run and operate the solution after the initial go-live in the run phase. The shift from traditional (heavy on design work in an empty system, resulting in highly customised solutions that take a long time to implement) to \"transformative for cloud\" approach (leverages predelivered, ready-to-run best practices; aims to reuse much of the predelivered functionality and standard functions of the solution; and uses an agile approach to implement the identified delta requirements and extensions to meet a company's needs) Key Components \u00b6 SAP Best Practices SAP Activate Methodology **SAP Activate Tools for Adoption and Extensibility SAP Activate Phases \u00b6 Discover \u00b6 Find the solution's capabilities, understand its business value and its benefits for the business, and determine an adoption strategy and road map in alignment with the solution's capabilities and product road map. Typical Key Deliverables - Strategic planning - Application value and scoping - Trial system access - Discovery assessment Prepare \u00b6 Begin initial planning and preparation of the project. - Project is started, plans are finalised, project team resources are assigned, and work is underway. - Initial technical application and application environment is provisioned or set up. - Collaboration tools and processes are agreed upon for the subsequent project phases, as additional functionality like virtual whiteboard, Kanban storyboards, task assignment tools etc. may become beneficial. Typical Key Deliverables - Project initiation - Project governance - Plan project, schedule, and budget - Project standards, infrastructure - Initial environment provisioning/setup and activation of best practices - Access to implementation supporting tools - Fit-to-standard preparation, including system preparation (functionality/data/authorisations) - End-user learning strategy - Phase closure and sign-off Explore \u00b6 Perform a fit-to-standard analysis to confirm the fit of the solution's standard functionality to the company's needs and to determine configuration values, necessary extensions, and analytics requirements, as well as identify required integrations, design identity, and access management. - Produce the finalised Functional and Technical solution designs, through a serious of System Walk-Through and GAP Analysis workshops. - The project team also prepares for data migration activities, plans testing, and begins putting together a learning team as part of the adoption workstream that manages the OCM and end-user enablement activities. Typical Key Deliverables - Gap Analysis documentation - Solution definition - Technical landscape design - Project Strategy Documentation - Change Strategy - Test Strategy - Integration planning and design - Extensions planning and design - Data load preparation - Mobilisation of the learning team - Phase closure and sign-off Realise \u00b6 Iteratively build, test and validate an integrated business and system environment based on the business scenarios and process requirements identified during the fit-to-standard analysis workshops in the explore phase. - Includes loading company data, performing adoption activities, and planning operations in the new environment - Completion and Unit testing of the configuration - System Integration Testing will be carried out by the project team to test processes and developments end to end - User Acceptance Testing will be executed by the Customer. This provides an opportunity for the business to test the solution according to scenarios determined to be realistic to their daily operations.

Portraying Valuation Frameworks \u00b6 Each chart of depreciation represents a collection of depreciation areas, which define an asset valuation based on various requirements in the country. Usually, more than one depreciation area is needed because your organisation will probably need to comply with multiple valuation principles in several countries. For example, in the US, companies must valuate their assets based on US GAAP. Additionally, big international companies will need to valuate their assets according to IFRS. Prior to S/4HANA (i.e. ERP), maintaining all these parallel valuation frameworks was a cumbersome process that required running periodic programs that would post the differences between the non-leading and leading valuation in even further delta depreciation areas. https://dxc.percipio.com/books/072e4012-c992-4deb-ada6-de10b856461d Defining Depreciation Areas \u00b6 Menu Path: Financial Accounting -> Asset Accounting -> General Valuation -> Depreciation Areas -> Define Depreciation Areas Configuration Fields Depreciation Area - Number of the depreciation area.

A complete rewrite of SAP ECC, revolving around the use of HANA as the central in-memory database. Unlike all previous SAP ERP products, S/4HANA will only work with HANA as its database. It provides organisations with software that addresses their business requirements across 26 verticals (i.e. niche markets). SAP S/4HANA comprises the S/4HANA Enterprise Management Digital Core, the component closest in scope to the SAP ERP (ECC) solution, and various lines of business (LoB) solutions, which are generally cloud solutions that are SAP products gained through mergers and acquisitions. Capabilities \u00b6 Procurement - Provides insight into purchasing operations, streamlines operational purchasing, automates contract management and sourcing, centralises procurement processes, reduces supply chain risk, manages commodity procurement, etc. Sales - Drive and manage sales performance, supports sales professionals and sales managers, maximises revenue with optimised sales processes for contract and order management, etc. Supply Chain - Provides more accurate commitment dates, achieves more streamlined warehouse management, optimises inventory processes for optimal inventory levels, integrates transportation management, etc. Manufacturing - Supports complex assembly execution, improves production planning, supports seamless manufacturing engineering, and accelerates manufacturing operations, including enhanced quality management R&D and Engineering - Improves product development and project control, as well as helping achieve effective management of enterprise-wide projects, better product lifecycle management, and improved efficiency through requirement-driven processes. Finance and Asset Management - Simplifies accounting processes and financial close, enables improvements to the treasury and financial risk processes, provides support for collaborative financial operations, helps simplify real estate management, etc. Professional Services - Optimises engagement profitability, achieves better staffing levels, helps capture time sheets faster with simplified entry, streamlines quote-to-cash processes, reimagines bid management processes, etc. Cross-Functional Capabilities - Cross-functional capabilities are used in human resources, asset operations and maintenance, and more Industry Capabilities - Industry capabilities are used across 28 industries, such as automotive, consumer, retail, mill, chemicals, and oil and gas Benefits \u00b6 Universal Journal - - While in SAP R/3, the various tasks in Management Accounting (CO) and Financial Accounting (FI) were handled by special modules with their respective data structures, the new general ledger in SAP ERP already provided a certain simplification and consolidation. SAP S/4HANA accounting is now taking the radical step of integrating all requirements into one application with a common data model. Editions \u00b6 See: Deployment Models NOTE: Hybrid Deployments - The hybrid operating model enables you to combine the characteristics of the on-premise and cloud operating models. For example, core areas of your enterprise, where you want a high degree of control and a high level of flexibility, can be operated on-premise, while other enterprise areas can be operated in the cloud as common industry standards are sufficient. - Especially useful if you have complex geographical structures or need distributed systems. - For example, you can have on-premise systems for a central ERP for headquarters where the corporation consolidates and reports financial results, and a cloud system for smaller or dedicated units focusing on sales and exploration. User Interfaces \u00b6 See: S4HANA User Interfaces SAP GUI - For on-premise SAP S/4HANA, SAP continues to offer classic access via the SAP GUI, which must be installed locally on the computer. - From a company's perspective, the SAP GUI can also be advantageous because employees don't need access to the Internet and can work only in the company network. Web GUI - An easier and more convenient alternative is to access via the web GUI. All you need is a browser, the URL, and access authorisation. This access is also possible via mobile devices. SAP Fiori - This replaces the traditional transaction codes of the SAP GUI with a web-based UI. - Fiori allows the concrete role and working environment of the respective user to be taken into account. The user will be assigned to business roles, such as general ledger accountant. To the business roles, specific apps are assigned. Tiles for apps that are specific to your business role appear when you access the system. App Classifications \u00b6 Regarding the function of the apps, SAP offers the following three types: Transactional Apps - These apps perform business process transactions or maintain master data. - Example Apps: Post General Journal Entry, Manage Supplier Invoice, Manage Cost Centre, and Post Activity Allocation. - The master data transactional apps are especially important because they provide a more user-friendly way for reviewing, creating, and changing master data by downloading and uploading. Many approval apps are personalised to the specific user and offer the ability to review, confirm, or reject documents when the user has the approver role (e.g., the time sheet approval in the project manager role). Analytical Apps - These apps are used to display real-time analytics on actual and plan data, including KPIs. There are numerous examples for these useful apps. These apps provide a drag and drop method for pulling in general ledger dimensions for reporting on line item or balance details. As mentioned, in principle, all Universal Journal fields are now available as reporting dimensions. - Report results can be downloaded to Excel and then converted to a graph for quick visual analysis. In addition, a report-to-report interface is available that allows further detail analysis with a different view. Fact Sheet Apps - These apps are used to display key facts about master data and to navigate directly to associated master data or business transactions. Fact sheet apps allow you to drill down to display or edit associated master data and relevant business transactions. - A good example is the Customer 360\u00b0 View app, which contains customer master data and provides a direct link to key contacts, quotations, sales orders, contracts, customer returns, and fulfilment issues. This dashboard is a powerful tool for users who need a quick overview of the customer's status.
