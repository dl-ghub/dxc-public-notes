## Overview
RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consult, Inform) is a tool to plan project resources. It lists work packages (activities) from the work breakdown structure down one side and the names of resources from the organisational breakdown structure across the top. 

**R (Responsible)**
- Identifies the person who owns an activity or is responsible for performing the work it includes.

**A (Accountable)**
- Identifies who must sign off or approve work before it is effective.
- This person is accountable for successful completion of a deliverable or work package.

**C (Consult)**
- Identifies who has the information or the capability needed to complete a deliverable or a work package.
- Shows who should be approached to provide input to the work or to decisions that need to be made during an activity

**I (Inform)**
- Identifies who must be informed of the progress or results of an activity, or of decisions associated with it.
- This person doesn't necessarily need to be consulted before work on an activity starts.
