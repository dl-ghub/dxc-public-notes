A ledger is a summary of transactions that relate to a certain account. For example, a bank ledger will summarise all the transactions that are involved in a bank account; a loan ledger will summarise all the transactions that are involved in a loan account and so on. 

A ledger consists of 4 things:
- An opening balance
- A debit side
- A credit side
- A closing balance
