Journal entries are important because they allow us to sort our transactions into manageable data. 


### Journal Entry Example

**Every transaction consists of two movements: a debit movement and a credit movement.** Be careful not to confuse this with the debit and credit *sides*. These are two different things.

Debit Accounts
- Debit = Increase
- Credit = Decrease

Credit Accounts
- Debit = Decrease
- Credit = Increase

In the example above, we are increasing the Expense account (debit side) by $100, and hence debiting it. We are taking money out of the bank, therefore reducing the Bank account (also debit side (cash)) by $100, and hence crediting it.
