## Key Concepts
SAP Activate is a project management approach. 

SAP Activate's main focus is on addressing questions during the transition projects, but it also offers guidance for the discovery activities in the discover phase and details of how to run and operate the solution after the initial go-live in the run phase. 

The shift from traditional (heavy on design work in an empty system, resulting in highly customised solutions that take a long time to implement) to "transformative for cloud" approach (leverages predelivered, ready-to-run best practices; aims to reuse much of the predelivered functionality and standard functions of the solution; and uses an agile approach to implement the identified delta requirements and extensions to meet a company's needs)

### Discover
Find the solution's capabilities, understand its business value and its benefits for the business, and determine an adoption strategy and road map in alignment with the solution's capabilities and product road map. 

**Typical Key Deliverables**
- Strategic planning
- Application value and scoping
- Trial system access
- Discovery assessment
---
### Prepare
Begin initial planning and preparation of the project. 
- Project is started, plans are finalised, project team resources are assigned, and work is underway.
- Initial technical application and application environment is provisioned or set up. 
- Collaboration tools and processes are agreed upon for the subsequent project phases, as additional functionality like virtual whiteboard, Kanban storyboards, task assignment tools etc. may become beneficial. 

**Typical Key Deliverables**
- Project initiation
- Project governance
- Plan project, schedule, and budget
- Project standards, infrastructure
- Initial environment provisioning/setup and activation of best practices
- Access to implementation supporting tools
- Fit-to-standard preparation, including system preparation (functionality/data/authorisations)
- End-user learning strategy
- Phase closure and sign-off
---
### Explore
Perform a fit-to-standard analysis to confirm the fit of the solution's standard functionality to the company's needs and to determine configuration values, necessary extensions, and analytics requirements, as well as identify required integrations, design identity, and access management.
- Produce the finalised Functional and Technical solution designs, through a serious of System Walk-Through and GAP Analysis workshops. 
- The project team also prepares for data migration activities, plans testing, and begins putting together a learning team as part of the adoption workstream that manages the OCM and end-user enablement activities.

**Typical Key Deliverables**
- Gap Analysis documentation
- Solution definition
- Technical landscape design
- Project Strategy Documentation
	- Change Strategy
	- Test Strategy
- Integration planning and design
- Extensions planning and design
- Data load preparation
- Mobilisation of the learning team
- Phase closure and sign-off
---
### Realise
Iteratively build, test and validate an integrated business and system environment based on the business scenarios and process requirements identified during the fit-to-standard analysis workshops in the explore phase. 
- Includes loading company data, performing adoption activities, and planning operations in the new environment
- Completion and Unit testing of the configuration
- System Integration Testing will be carried out by the project team to test processes and developments end to end
- User Acceptance Testing will be executed by the Customer. This provides an opportunity for the business to test the solution according to scenarios determined to be realistic to their daily operations. 

**Typical Key Deliverables**
- Fully configured system including interfaces developed and tested, data cleansed, data conversion programs created and tested, and cutover plan created
- Post go-live support arrangements defined and approved
- Training materials created and training schedule specified
- Security access designed and tested
- Data trial conversions completed
- Cutover planning
- Optional activation of additional scope items
---
### Deploy
Complete the preparation of the business transition to the new solution. This includes training, final data conversion, and system cutover activities.

**Typical Key Deliverables**
- Dress rehearsal
- Production cutover
- Operation readiness
- Hypercare support
- Stabilisation of production environment after cutover
- Handover to support organisation
---
### Run
This phase represents the initial business go-live period to project closure. Key activities include initial end user support period, project handover to ongoing support, and where relevant, first month end/period close support.

**Typical Key Deliverables**
- Ongoing system operations
- New scope activation
- New country/countries activation
- Setup and onboarding of new users
