While segments are used for external reporting, profit centres are internal units. They allow better controlling because you can follow the money in each unit and assign responsibility in accordance with results. Likewise, profit centres that are doing poorly are easier to identify and correct because their inefficiencies aren't easily masked by the surplus of a well-performing group.
