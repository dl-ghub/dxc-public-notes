## Asset Class Overview

An asset class is the main master data object that forms the organisational structure of [[Asset Accounting (J62)]]. The object serves to classify together assets that have a similar function and purpose. Think of an asset class as a grouping of similar assets that provide numerous controlling characteristics to its member assets, such as the number ranges within which they are created, the accounts that they post to, the fields available in their master records, and so on. 

### Structuring Asset Classes

Assets should be grouped in the same asset class when they have similar properties like the following:
- Account determination
- Screen layout
- Number range assignment
- Additional features
- Default values
- Selections

NOTE: The asset class is not dependent on a company code or a chart of depreciation. Therefore, when you create them, asset classes can be available to all countries and company codes. 

Typically, around 20 to 30 asset classes should fulfil the needs of most global companies.
