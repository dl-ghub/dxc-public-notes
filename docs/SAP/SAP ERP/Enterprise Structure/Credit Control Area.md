## Credit Control Area
Higher Level(s): [[Company Code]]
Lower Level(s):

The credit control area serves as the main hub where decisions on customer credit are made. It specifies and checks the limit for each individual customer in both accounts receivable and sales and distribution. 

This can be done in one of two ways: a *decentralised* approach or a *central management* approach. In the former, a separate area is assigned to each company code. This allows credit to be awarded within a singular relationship.

But sometimes a customer will be involved with multiple company codes. This is where the central management approach comes into play. This combines all the different iterations of the same customer within different company codes into one control area, streamlining the credit checking and assigning process.
