## Company
Higher Level(s): [[Client]]
Lower Level(s): [[Company Code]]
Intended by SAP in the system for a legal entity. It therefore describes a business organisation for which accounting must be performed and a balance sheet must be drawn up for legal reasons. 
- However, legal independence is not a mandatory prerequisite for setting up a company in the system. For example, a legally dependent branch or permanent establishment can also be created as a company to be addressed as a consolidation element.

**Similar to the client as a technical framework, the company conceptually represents a framework within which various organisational elements relevant to accounting can be defined. Therefore, basic elements for accounting, such as the chart of accounts, aren't defined on a company level.** 

Because the consolidated financial statements can primarily be understood as the consolidation of legally independent companies, it's logical that the company element is used for consolidation in SAP. It's also called *trading partner* in the reports, which makes the meaning as legal entity a bit clearer.
