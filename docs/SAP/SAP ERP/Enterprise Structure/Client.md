## Client
Higher Level(s): None
Lower Level(s): [[Company]]


The client describes the technical framework of the system and is therefore the highest organisational element. All other levels of enterprise structure are located within a client. 

When implementing a system for a corporate group, from an accounting point of view, you should insist on mapping the entire corporate group within a client. This brings enormous advantages for master data management, the design of processes, and the representation of the group of companies in consolidation according to legal and business dimensions. 

In the past, large corporations often installed several clients over the course of time, and even within the one company, different clients were sometimes installed in parallel. In this case, from an accounting point of view, it's therefore important for you to know how the coexistence of different clients can be organised in SAP.
