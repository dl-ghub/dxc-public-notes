Roof of Umbrella. 

The controlling area identifies a self-contained organisational structure for which costs and revenues can be managed and allocated. It represents a separate unit of cost accounting. One or more company codes can be assigned to a controlling area, which enables you to carry out cross-company code cost accounting between the assigned company codes. however, this is only possible if the assigned company codes and the controlling area all use the same operating chart of accounts.
