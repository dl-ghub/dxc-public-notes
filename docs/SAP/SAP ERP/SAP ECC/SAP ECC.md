# SAP ECC Modules/Components

Companies typically choose to implement FICO, MM and SD first, though they can pick and choose which modules they want. 

Whilst offering major flexibility, this system comes with inherent complexity.

SAP is now trying to push companies to the cloud versions of S/4HANA, which standardises offerings, though at the cost of flexibility. To compensate, it is also developing industry-focused versions of S/4HANA to match the flexibility traditionally offered by ECC. 


# Future of SAP ECC
SAP is pushing companies to implement S/4HANA while promising to support ECC and other core Business Suite 7 applications until the end of 2027, with optional extended maintenance until the end of 2030.
