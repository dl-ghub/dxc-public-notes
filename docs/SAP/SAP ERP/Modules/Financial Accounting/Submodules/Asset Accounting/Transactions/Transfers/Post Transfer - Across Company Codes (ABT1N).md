## Usage
You need to transfer an asset from one company code to another. This process is needed, for example, when the ownership of an existing asset is changed between legal entities of the same group. 


## Notes
- As the sale is being transacted from one company code to another, you'll need to choose an option in the Specifications for Revenue section. You can select No Revenue, enter a particular revenue amount in the Manual Revenue field, or enter a depreciation area in the Rev. from NBV field. From your settings, the system will determine the revenue based on the net book value of the asset.
