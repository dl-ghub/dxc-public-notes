## Usage
Scrapping of an asset is a process where you decompose an asset without any revenue. In most cases, when organisations use an asset for a specific period of time and when an asset wears out completely, they scrap that asset. Hence, they book losses on the remaining value of the asset. 

## Notes
- Requires a fixed asset code with acquisition and depreciation values before you can scrap an asset. 
- Even if depreciation values are not there, you can still scrap an asset with losses amounting to the acquisition value. However, this is very rare in an organisation. Usually, companies only scrap it once the asset has been used for a long period of time or till its useful life.
