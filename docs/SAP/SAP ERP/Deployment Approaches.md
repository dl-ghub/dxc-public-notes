The path which an organisation chooses for their deployment is dependent on their business objective.

**New Enterprise Core**
- Business is looking to introduce SAP S/4HANA as their dominant ERP system, whilst minimising the impact on existing business operations.
- Typically businesses in this category already operate SAP ERP (ECC) and want to convert to SAP S/4HANA, while considering implementation of innovations such as universal journal, embedded analytics, or SAP Fiori UX for selected functions in the organisation where this change allows for introducing innovation with minimal disruption. 
- Initiatives in this category typically are sponsored by the chief information officer (CIO)

**Extended Enterprise Core**
- Focus is on optimisation and redesign of selected business processes based on best value or return on investment (ROI). 
- Companies in this category have a choice of converting their existing environment to the SAP S/4HANA solution or implementing the SAP S/4HANA solution as new. 
	- Selecting the optimal approach is largely driven by the scope of "outdated" business processes that will need to be redesigned.

**Enterprise Transformation**
- Business is in the middle of a comprehensive business transformation, or business is implementing new business models in line with transformation goals. 
- Companies will typically plan their transition to SAP S/4HANA as a multistage road map aligned with their business transformation goals, and a significant portion of the road map will be new implementations of new business processes to support transformation goals. 
- Sponsorship of such transformation is typically directly from the CEO.
