The path which an organisation chooses for their deployment is dependent on their business objective.

# SAP ERP Products
- [[S4HANA/S4HANA]]
- [[SAP ECC]]
- [[R/3]]


# SAP ERP Modules
[[Financial Accounting|FI - Financial Accounting]]
[[Controlling (Management Accounting)|CO - Controlling (Management Accounting)]]
[[Materials Management|MM - Materials Management]]
[[Sales and Distribution|SD - Sales and Distribution]]
[[Project Systems|PS - Project Systems]]
[[Human Capital Management|HCM - Human Capital Management (HR)]]
[[Quality Management|QM - Quality Management]]
[[Plant Maintenance|PM - Plant Maintenance]]
[[Project Planning|PP - Project Planning]]

Companies typically choose to implement FICO, MM and SD first, though they can pick and choose which modules they want. 

SAP is now trying to push companies to the cloud versions of S/4HANA, which standardises offerings, though at the cost of flexibility. To compensate, it is also developing industry-focused versions of S/4HANA to match the flexibility traditionally offered by ECC.
