[[SAP GUI]]
- For on-premise SAP S/4HANA, SAP continues to offer classic access via the SAP GUI, which must be installed locally on the computer. 
- From a company's perspective, the SAP GUI can also be advantageous because employees don't need access to the Internet and can work only in the company network. 

[[Web GUI]]
- An easier and more convenient alternative is to access via the web GUI. All you need is a browser, the URL, and access authorisation. This access is also possible via mobile devices.

[[SAP Fiori]]
- This replaces the traditional transaction codes of the SAP GUI with a web-based UI.
- Fiori allows the concrete role and working environment of the respective user to be taken into account. The user will be assigned to business roles, such as general ledger accountant. To the business roles, specific apps are assigned. Tiles for apps that are specific to your business role appear when you access the system.
