For on-premise SAP S/4HANA, SAP continues to offer classic access via the SAP GUI, which must be installed locally on the computer.

After you're in the system, it's irrelevant whether the access was made with the SAP GUI or with the web GUI. The old SAP GUI may be a bit more familiar and practical because you can start it directly from your PC. From a company's point of view, the SAP GUI can also be advantageous because employees don't need access to the Internet and can work only in the company network.
