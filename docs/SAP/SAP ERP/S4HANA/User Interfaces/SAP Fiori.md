An important component of SAP S/4HANA is the completely redesigned user experience. This replaces the traditional transaction codes of the SAP GUI with a web-based UI.

The login page shown immediately boosts the expectation that you're about to access a new SAP world.

After the login, you're greeted by a visually designed UI that allows a very intuitive use of the various functions.

The SAP Fiori launchpad offers many possibilities to individually design this UI and the start-up screen. This allows the concrete role and working environment of the respective user to be taken into account. The user will be assigned to business roles, such as general ledger accountant. To the business roles, specific apps are assigned. Tiles for apps that are specific to your business role appear when you access the system.
