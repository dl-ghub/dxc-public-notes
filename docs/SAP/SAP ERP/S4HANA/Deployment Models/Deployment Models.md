NOTE: Hybrid Deployments
- The hybrid operating model enables you to combine the characteristics of the on-premise and cloud operating models. For example, core areas of your enterprise, where you want a high degree of control and a high level of flexibility, can be operated on-premise, while other enterprise areas can be operated in the cloud as common industry standards are sufficient. 
- Especially useful if you have complex geographical structures or need distributed systems. 
	- For example, you can have on-premise systems for a central ERP for headquarters where the corporation consolidates and reports financial results, and a cloud system for smaller or dedicated units focusing on sales and exploration.
