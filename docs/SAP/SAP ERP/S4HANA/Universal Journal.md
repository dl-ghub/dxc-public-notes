## Universal Journal
The Universal Journal can undoubtedly be described as the heart of SAP S/4HANAâ€”at least from an accountant's point of view. It offers the potential for a drastic simplification of processes in financial accounting and management accounting while simultaneously increasing the reporting functionality.

While in SAP R/3, the various tasks in Management Accounting (CO) and Financial Accounting (FI) were handled by special modules with their respective data structures, the new general ledger in SAP ERP already provided a certain simplification and consolidation. SAP S/4HANA accounting is now taking the radical step of integrating all requirements into one application with a common data model.

## Single Source of Truth
In the past, the various data structures and applications required a great deal of reconciliation work, for example, to show identical sales revenues and operating results in CO and FI in SAP ERP. The goal was to achieve a single point of truth, which could only be accomplished through hard work. With the Universal Journal in SAP S/4HANA, this goal is already reached at the starting point, so that you actually have a single source of truth that makes the reconciliation work obsolete.


## Benefits
Some benefits of the Universal Journal are summarised as follows:
