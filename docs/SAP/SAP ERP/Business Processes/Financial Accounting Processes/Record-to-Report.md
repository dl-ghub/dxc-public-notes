## Record-to-Report

Record-to-report is a financial and accounting management process which ensures that all business processes (e.g., sales, purchases, payments, etc.) are recorded completely and accurately within an accounting system and its (sub-)ledgers and that all entered transactions are ultimately collected and recorded in the general ledger. 

From an accounting perspective, the record-to-report process is the most important process because it involves accounting's responsibility for properly documenting business transactions and providing reliable information about the course of business. All accounting-related postings in the different areas ultimately converge in the general ledger, where they form the basis for financial reports.

The process is based on clear definitions of the company's structures and master data. Current postings and periodic closing are the operative activities in the general ledger. On this basis, reports can then be generated for various purposes.

Today, individual companies as legal entities are often part of a group of companies for which consolidated financial statements must be created. A very important task in accounting is therefore the identification and recording of intercompany transactions in preparation for consolidation. This is especially true for the general ledger, where the reconciliation and elimination of intercompany transactions must be supported.
