## Order-to-Cash

It's certainly no exaggeration to describe the order-to-cash process as the lifeline of a company. This process is the link to the customers to whom the company must offer a value added with its services and products. In return, the customer provides the company with the liquidity it needs to continue as a business.

The order-to-cash process already starts with the first customer contacts in SAP Customer Relationship Management (SAP CRM). However, the process only becomes relevant for accounting when contract information is generated, which later arrives in accounting. This can be an inquiry or an offer where personal- and product-related information has already been exchanged.

Measures of the performance of the order-to-cash process are throughput time, delivery quality, and payment behaviour. 
Fiori offers a variety of apps that assist with managing and controlling the processes with actual data (e.g., the Sales Order Fulfilment app shown below.)

In the above app, you can see the orders and the different stages of the process. By clicking on the bars, you'll get further information, and you can drill down to the relevant list of the orders and finally view the individual order.
