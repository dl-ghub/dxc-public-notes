The acquire-to-retire process provides a company with fixed assets that could last several years. SAP provides the tools to support this process over this long period of time, as shown in [Figure 2.5](https://cdn2.percipio.com/1649222545.a641d196053a9d9ae0e1807d9549ca0805e6f477/eod/books/149888/OEBPS/section-21-14.xhtml#f2.5 "Figure 2.5: Acquire-to-Retire Process Overview").

You can see that the process can be divided into four phases. Whereas the pre-acquisition and acquisition phases are mainly supported by the purchasing area, the monitoring phase is supported by the fixed assets department in accounting. [Figure 2.5](https://cdn2.percipio.com/1649222545.a641d196053a9d9ae0e1807d9549ca0805e6f477/eod/books/149888/OEBPS/section-21-14.xhtml#f2.5 "Figure 2.5: Acquire-to-Retire Process Overview") shows the main functionalities in this process until the different forms of retirement, which are also supported within fixed assets.
