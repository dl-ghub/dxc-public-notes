## Purchase-to-Pay

Purchase-to-pay or, procurement-to-pay, is the other core process that represents the value chain of a company. Two aspects underline the importance of this process: On one hand, the saying "profit lies in purchasing" clearly indicates the close connection between purchasing and a company's success. On the other hand, this process is associated with spending money, so from an internal control point of view, it's paramount to ensure that the right amount of money goes to the right payee and that the expenses go to the correct cost.

The purchase requisition comes from different departments and arrives at the purchasing organisation. The request for quotation and purchase order are the mainstays of purchasing. Fulfilment again affects different departments. With invoice checking, the information from purchasing (ordered quantity at a certain price) must now be compared with the information from fulfilment (correct quantity) and the data on the invoice (price and quantity), so that the payment can be released.
