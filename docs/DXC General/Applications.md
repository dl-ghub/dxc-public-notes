Industry breakdown does NOT include any profits from practices (i.e. Connect, Oracle, SAP etc.). 
- This is done partly to avoid double counting. Industry breakdown is comprised of non-practice offering such as cloud, security, and ITO (i.e. GIS)


## An Overview of the Practices 
![[Pasted image 20220301140813.png]]
- Targeting 21-23% POP every year.

### Revenue
- All revenue is recognised on an accrual acounting method. Revenue is not recorded when the client is invoiced, but when the work is done. 
	- Non-Fixed Price Project
		- If someone is charging $1000/day and they work for 22 days, then we record $22,000 worth of revenue regardless of how much we have currently invoiced the client for (could be only $15,000 for example). 
		- This keeps everything aligned in our books. 
	- Fixed Price Project
		- We track the value that we have provided for a client over a project using an ERC model. This means we don't need to wait until reaching project milestones before recording revenue. But we need to demonstrate (through an audit process) that we are delivering that value. 
##### Service Revenue



##### Resell Revenue
- When the product is an on-premise license, we will take that license upfront and recognise the total value of that and recognise it. 

### Costs
##### Delivery Pool Costs
- Includes bench costs, costs for solution architects, and costs for some consultants. 


##### S&M 
- Cost of any Sales or Management team members.
